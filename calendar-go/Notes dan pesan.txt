1. ok fisrt explanation , the code structure is fkd up from the beginning so yeaah there is that,
 definetly need some work to clean that mess.

2. the backlog itself is thoughtless and in the end it causes problems
	- why you need to put backlog to add event and delete event(singularly )if in the end you need to add
		code to add and delete multiple event 
		(bruh moment)

	- the backlog didnt state to edit multiple evnt , but since now it contains multiple events, 
	  	a new backlog needs to be integrated in order for that function to work.
		(the current edit event function doesnt work now )
